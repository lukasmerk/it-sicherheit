/**
 ** LargeInt 
 ** A structure to hold the data of a large integer.
 **/
/**
 ** data
 **        An array to store the actual data of the integer. It
 **        is stored as follows: data[0] contains the least
 **        significant digit, data[usedWords-1] holds the most
 **        significant digit. Each digit is stored in little-endian
 **        format. For each digit, BITSPERWORD bits are
 **        used to store information about the integer. The
 **        remaining bits are reserved for computations.
 **/
/**
 ** bitSize
 **        Contains the number of bits up to the leftmost
 **        bit that is set to one. If there is no bit
 **        that is set to one, then this value is set to 0.
 **/
/**
 ** wordSize
 **        The number of uint32 words in the data array. This value
 **        should be set once, when the BigInt is initialized and
 **        never be changed until it is destroyed.
 **/
/**
 ** usedWords
 **        The number of uint32 words in the data array
 **        which actually hold information about the integer.
 **        This means, that this value is wordSize minus the
 **        number of leading zero-words.
 **        If all words in the data array are set to 0, the
 **        value of this variable is 0.
